### **🧠 Question 1: Transaction Propagation**

  

> What is the difference between REQUIRED and REQUIRES_NEW in Spring’s transaction propagation behavior? Describe a scenario where choosing one over the other is critical.

### **🧠 Question 2: Performance Under High Load**

  

> Suppose your service has a @Transactional(readOnly = true) query that suddenly starts showing latency under high concurrency. What are the plausible causes, and how would you investigate and fix them?

## 모범 답안
### 1)
> REQUIRED joins an existing transaction if present; otherwise, it creates a new one. REQUIRES_NEW always suspends any existing transaction and creates a new, independent transaction. This distinction matters, for example, when logging audit events in a separate transaction regardless of parent success/failure.


### 2)
> readOnly queries should not trigger context flush, but if latency occurs, investigate locking (long-running writes), missing indexes, DB resource saturation, or connection pool exhaustion. Use database tools (SHOW PROCESSLIST, performance_schema, APM) to diagnose.
